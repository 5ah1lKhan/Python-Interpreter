# Sample program for basic arithmetic and assignments

# Assign values
a = 10;
b = 5;

# Perform calculations
sum = a + b;      # sum = 15
diff = a - b;     # diff = 5
prod = a * b;     # prod = 50 (using * instead of x)
quot = a / b;     # quot = 2 (integer division)
rem = a % b;      # rem = 0

# More complex expression
complex_expr = (a + b) * 2 - (a / 5) + (10 % 3);
# complex_expr = (10 + 5) * 2 - (10 / 5) + (10 % 3)
# complex_expr = 15 * 2 - 2 + 1
# complex_expr = 30 - 2 + 1
# complex_expr = 28 + 1
# complex_expr = 29

# Reassign variable
a = sum + 1; # a = 15 + 1 = 16
