# Sample program demonstrating while loop

# Initialize counter and sum
counter = 5;
sum_val = 0;

# While loop to sum numbers from 5 down to 1
while (counter) { # Loop continues as long as counter is non-zero
    sum_val = sum_val + counter;
    counter = counter - 1;
}

# After the loop:
# counter should be 0
# sum_val should be 5 + 4 + 3 + 2 + 1 = 15

# Another example: Factorial calculation (e.g., 4!)
num = 4;
factorial = 1;
iterator = num;

while (iterator) {
    factorial = factorial * iterator;
    iterator = iterator - 1;
}

# After the loop:
# iterator should be 0
# factorial should be 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 24
